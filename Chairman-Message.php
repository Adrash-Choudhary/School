<h4>"The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet." - Aristotle</h4>

<p align="justify">
It is my immense pleasure in welcoming you all to Gyansarovar Public School, Saharsa. 
The school has successfully replicated the excellence that the other Schools in India and 
abroad have shown in providing holistic education to its students with prodigious emphasis 
on traditional values. Education ameliorates the lives of people and harbingers growth and 
stability to the nation.

    <p align="justify">
        Coupled with this, it is important that identical opportunities are 
given to both men and women in society so that the growth of the nation would be more exponential. 
Holistic education encompasses not only structured academics but also life's valuable lessons 
that one can imbibe from experiences gained through opportunities. And obviously, making the 
right choices at the right time and working your way towards making it a success.<br><br>
Gyansarovar Public School, Saharsa aspires to be a community that believes in preparing its 
children for life in the 21st Century. In practising so, we aim to give you a school that 
esteems heritage, has strong ethos of mutual respect and courtesy and excellent standards of 
care and education. Our goals and vision are reflected in the daily life of the school. We, at 
GPS Saharsa, maintain that every child has individual skills and talents, which should be valued 
and encouraged. At all levels there is a true commitment to our goal of moulding "good pupils 
and good people". Our mission is to prepare our students to meet the future with skill, confidence, 
clarity in thought, decision-making ability, supremacy and generosity of spirit.<br><br>
When I introspect, I realise how far have we travelled, how much achieved and how much grown; 
the past sprouts up with accolades uncounted. That is because we have always been able to give 
our students the best of all facilities for their holistic educationAt present, shaping the lives 
of 600+ students, GPS Saharsa promises to build the future citizens with decision-making ability and 
clarity in their thoughts and actions. The management thus, is ever committed to deliver its best 
for the educational and economic development of the region.<br><br>
The infrastructure of the school is comparable to world standards with state-of-the-art security 
systems and sports facilities. The medical and the support staff are highly trained to act quickly 
in an emergency and are always vigilant and alert. The school always focuses towards shaping the 
well-disciplined students who are also adequately mushroomed with traditional values. Education all 
over the world is undergoing a radical shift. Knowledge is no longer constrained by time and space. 
It has expanded beyond the classrooms and school campuses. Hence, continuous mentoring, monitoring 
and evaluation of the learning environment need to be done to provide required intellectual stimulation to the young minds.<br><br>
While creating curriculum designs, value orientation and social mobility should remain in prime focus. 
Schools should aim at grooming the students into ethical and principled leaders of tomorrow, whose 
thoughts and actions are deeply implanted in the values and culture of our land. The students are 
being nurtured well and are made ready to face the world and its challenges. We are not here just 
to impart the bookish knowledge but also to groom them into kind, compassionate, courageous, just 
and reliable human beings and assets to the society. We are confident that this school is the best 
place for your child. We welcome your active interest and involvement in the progress and activities 
of your ward. We look forward to your continuous support.
